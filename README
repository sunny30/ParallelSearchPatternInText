SYSTEM REQUIREMENT:
Must have jdk and jre above 1.6
Operating system has to be Unix platform only(Mac,linux,etc).
Support of Multithreading in the operating system.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Sample:"On the line-Number 57 Total Count in this line: 1 offsets on this lines are 0 
On the line-Number 15475 Total Count in this line: 1 offsets on this lines are 0" 

I have changed  the output format tried to make more relevant which help anybody to verify if book is open in vi or emac editor

if there is a match than line-Number and offset on that line.

and at end total count of matches

Caution : Search is case senstive, while verifying answer against total count using search in doc please make sure that your search in doc is case insenstive or not
In my case "they" has 613 matches but using "command F" it is showing 956 than i figured out that  doc search is treating "they","They","THEY" as same.

HOW TO RUN
open run.sh 

java com.company.Main <bookname with path under double quotes> <phrae under double quotes>  <number of thread> <want to enable log than put 1 else 0>

SAMPLE:
java com.company.Main "/Users/sharad.singh/Devp/SearchPhraseInTest/D. H. Lawrence - Sons And Lovers.txt" "About this time"  20 1

open run.sh and edit at the line 4 accordingly
I could have done the entire automation through command line argument but book as well pharase can have space
but since double quotes got removed in shell script and code is treating them as seperate command line argument.Tried with sed and awk but for a while left...down with fever.

After verifying ..please run again it with logEnabled means put it's value 1. It will depict the beautiful parallelization among threads It is just a show case of my code and work.Messages will give you proper idea how theads are woking on which line
Follow the sample mentioned above.

CODING GUIDELINE:
Given enough comments on code.
Used simplest approach so no extra third party library/jar which will cause some exception after forking in different enviorment .


ALGORITHM
1)Created thread pool
2)Started readig lines
	if(line length is less than pattern length)
		read next line
	else
		Submit that line to worker thread
3)Collect the responses 
4)Check the reposne if it has something valid as per search out put it
